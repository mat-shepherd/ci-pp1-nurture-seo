### User Stories
I have divided my user stories into prospective customers, existing customers, and site owners, as each of these users will have a distinct set of needs and goals.

#### Prospective Customers
1. As a prospective customer, I want to see a list of the services offered by the consultant so that I can understand if the consultant can provide the solution my business is seeking.
2. As a prospective customer, I want to see a description of each service so I can understand the services provided.
3. As a prospective customer, I want to see details of the pricing or price range of the services so that I can understand if the consultant's services fit within my allocated budget and are likely to provide return on investment.
4. As a prospective customer, I want to see details of the consultant's experience, past customers, and examples of their work or results so that I can feel confident the consultant can deliver the results my business expects.
5. As a prospective customer, I want to see details of the consultant's work experience and expertise to understand if they have the expertise required to handle my project.
6. As a prospective customer, I want to submit questions or details of my project through the website so I can connect with the consultant to discuss my project and receive answers, set up, a call or receive a project proposal.
7. As a prospective customer, I want to locate the consultant's contact details so I can see where they are located and phone or email them about my project and any questions I may have.
8. As a prospective customer, I want to locate the consultant's social media details so I can see if they are thought leaders in the space, learn from their content, and see what other social media users say about them.

## Design

### Design Choices
I researched other digital marketing agency websites to find a bright, clean, and simple layout that fit my desired content and that was also responsive. I based my site design on the layout of [Workhu's](https://workhu.com/) website.

### Colour
As the agency focuses on growth through SEO and is called Nurture SEO I chose elemental (earth, water, sun, air) and organic (plants) colours to convey organic growth.

Primary Colours - White / Green

Secondary Colours - Yellow / Blue

To remain WCAG AAA accessible I chose dark colour variants for background colours behind white text to mantain maximum contrast.
